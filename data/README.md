### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories. Some of the datasets have not been uploaded due to large volume.

Here are the original sources from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) for the data.
